# OWASP

## Information/Actions
Types of issues  
Injection:  
    1. Type mismatch  

Exfilteration of information  
    1. HTTP to HTTPS  
    2. Invalid server config  

Audience: Software developers  
Part1. Building Secure software  
Part2. Looking at Top 10 Owasp vulnerablilities  
Part3. Demo of the above  
    Basic working simulations  

## Demos to work on
Experiments:  
1. HTTP/HTTPS non secure data transfer  
    * Maybe enforcing https only on browser  

2. Dictionary attacks (possibly)  
    * Reads a word and tries login continuously  

3. SQL Injection  
    * Having a webserver, and trying to attempt an SQL injection through another client.  

4. XSS, Cross Site Scripting (Type Violating)  
    * Injecting script through html in text field  
    * Ex: Filling a html script in a form.  
    * Same domain cookies stored as a result of same domain cookies.  

5. Invalid server config / Security misconfiguration  
    * can possibily be combined with 1.  
    * ssh auth instead of password based auth  

6. CSRF(Not part of top 10) - Maybe

|4. | Akshat: | Http/Https  | 

Contemporary real world stories, not only examples relating further to how close these threats are to us in real life.

### Planned Approach
Http -> XSS -> SQL Injection ->
